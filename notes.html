              </li>
              <li>competition-driven design causes products to grow more similar, companies should look to highlight their strengths instead</li>
              <li>sometimes intentionally add friction (ex. for safety and privacy concerns)</li>
              <li>Western cultures value capitalism, so our design often involves attractive exterior features</li>

              <li>impossible to know whether the majority of onlookers agree or disagree because we can't perceive silence on social media like we can in-person</li>

                </ul>

              <li>most people think of writing as a way to communicate personal thoughts to others</li>
              <li>more importantly, it also expands working (short-term) and long-term memory</li>
              <li>studies have shown that working memory is highly correlated with IQ</li>
              <li>computers hold more memory, so our brains can focus on higher order tasks (offload an idea)</li>
              <li>externalizing something clarifies your thinking</li>

              <li>the art of writing is mostly unblocking yourself</li>
              <li>focus on pulling ideas out of your head
              <li>write fast and just get thoughts out, ignore typos </li>
              <li>record rambling thoughts while walking</li>

              <li>most important habit you can develop is shipping something on a regular basis</li>
              <li>like working out, writing is a lot easier with some initial momentum</li>
              <li>never start with a blank page, give yourself an anchor</li>
              <li>write the intro last, start with the most boring / procedural piece to pick up steam
                <ul>
                  <li>this boring part may end up being the most important</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>when researching something new, make sure it has a tie to something you already know well</li>
              <li>to write in a compelling way, create sides and take one (hero vs villain > true vs false)</li>
